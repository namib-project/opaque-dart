# libopaque dart bindings

These bindings provide access to libopaque which implements the
[IRTF CFRG RFC draft](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque)
or you can read the [original paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/163).

## Dependencies

These bindings depend on the following:
  - libopaque
  - libsodium

A compiled library of both libopaque and libsodium must be available to use these bindings.

## Usage

To use the libopaque bindings, your first have to initialize an `Opaque` object
with both libopaque and libsodium libraries. Please refer to the [libopaque](https://github.com/stef/libopaque) and [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/installation) documentations on how to install these libraries properly.

### VM - loading the dynamic library
In the dart VM, `dart:ffi` is used as a backend to load and interact with the libopaque/libsodium binaries. All you need to do is load such a library and pass it to the `Opaque.init` constructor. This generally looks like this:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:opaque/opaque.dart';

// load the dynamic libraries into dart
final libopaque = DynamicLibrary.open('/path/to/libopaque.XXX'); // or DynamicLibrary.process()
final libsodium = DynamicLibrary.open('/path/to/libsodium.XXX'); // or DynamicLibrary.process()

final opaque = Opaque.init(libopaque, libsodium);
// using the opaque.* API
```

### Transpiled JavaScript - loading the JavaScript code
The usage is quite similar to the VM loading usage, except that you have to load the libopaque.js and libsodium.js source code files instead of the dynamic library binaries. The general usage looks something like this:

```dart
import 'package:opaque/opaque.dart';

final sodiumJS = // somehow load the sodium.js into dart
final opaqueJS = // somehow load the opaque.js into dart

final opaque = Opaque.init(opaqueJS, sodiumJS);
// using the opaque.* API
```

## API

_Note that all `Opaque.*` API calls will throw an `ArgumentError` if the API call failed_.

### `OpaqueIds`
The IDs of the peers are passed around as a class object:
```dart
final OpaqueIds ids = OpaqueIds(Uint8List.fromList("user".codeUnits), Uint8List.fromList("server".codeUnits));
```

## 1-step registration

1-step registration is only specified in the original paper. It is not specified by the IRTF
CFRG draft. 1-step registration has the benefit that the supplied password (`pwdU`) can be checked
on the server for password rules (e.g., occurrence in common password
lists). It has the drawback that the password is exposed to the server.

```dart
final result = opaque.Register(pwdU, ids, skS: skS);
final rec = result["rec"]!;
final export_key = result["export_key"]!;
```
 - `pwdU` is the user's password as an `Uint8List` object.
 - `ids` is an `OpaqueIds` struct that contains the IDs of the user and the server.
 - `skS` is an optional server long-term private-key

## 4-step registration

Registration as specified in the IRTF CFRG draft consists of the
following 4 steps:

### Step 1: The user creates a registration request.

```dart
final result = opaque.CreateRegistrationRequest(pwdU);
final request = result["request"]!;
final secU = result["sec"]!;
```

- `pwdU` is the user's password as an `Uint8List` object.

The user should hold on to `secU` securely until step 3 of the registration process.
`request` needs to be passed to the server running step 2.

### Step 2: The server responds to the registration request.

```dart
final result = opaque.CreateRegistrationResponse(request, skS: skS);
final secS = result["sec"]!;
final pub = result["pub"]!;
```

 - `request` comes from the user running the previous step.
 - `skS` is an optional server long-term private-key

The server should hold onto `secS` securely until step 4 of the registration process.
`pub` should be passed to the user running step 3.

### Step 3: The user finalizes the registration using the response from the server.

```dart
final result = opaque.FinalizeRequest(secU, pub, ids);
final rec0 = result["reg_rec"]!;
final export_key = result["export_key"]!;
```

 - `secU` contains sensitive data and should be disposed securely after usage in this step.
 - `pub` comes from the server running the previous step.
 - `ids` is an `Ids` struct that contains the IDs of the user and the server.

 - `rec0` should be passed to the server running step 4.
 - `export_key` is an extra secret that can be used to encrypt
   additional data that you might want to store on the server next to
   your record.

### Step 4: The server finalizes the user's record.

```dart
final result = opaque.StoreUserRecord(secS, rec0);
final rec1 = result["rec"]!;
```

 - `rec0` comes from the user running the previous step.
 - `secS` contains sensitive data and should be disposed securely after usage in this step.

 - `rec1` should be stored by the server associated with the ID of the user.

**Important Note**: Confusingly this function is called `StoreUserRecord`, yet it
does not do any storage. How you want to store the record (`rec1`) is up
to the implementor using this API.

## Establishing an opaque session

After a user has registered with a server, the user can initiate the
AKE and thus request its credentials in the following 3(+1)-step protocol:

### Step 1: The user initiates a credential request.

```dart
final result = opaque.CreateCredentialRequest(pwdU);
final pub = result["pub"]!;
final secU = result["secU"]!;
```

 - `pwdU` is the user's password as an `Uint8List` object.

The user should hold onto `secU` securely until step 3 of the protocol.
`pub` needs to be passed to the server running step 2.

### Step 2: The server responds to the credential request.

```dart
final result = opaque.CreateCredentialResponse(pub, rec, ids, context);
final resp = result["resp"]!;
final sk = result["sk"]!;
final authU = result["authU"]!;
```

 - `pub` comes from the user running the previous step.
 - `rec` is the user's record stored by the server at the end of the registration protocol.
 - `ids` is an `OpaqueIds` struct that contains the IDs of the user and the server.
 - `context` is a `Uint8List` distinguishing this instantiation of the protocol from others, e.g. "MyApp-v0.2"

 - `resp` needs to be passed to the user running step 3.
 - `sk` is a shared secret, the result of the AKE.
 - The server should hold onto `authU` securely until the optional step
   4 of the protocol, if needed. otherwise this value should be
   discarded securely.

### Step 3: The user recovers its credentials from the server's response.

```dart
final result = opaque.RecoverCredentials(resp, secU, context, ids: ids);
final sk = result["sk"]!;
final authU1 = result["authU"]!;
final export_key = result["export_key"]!;
```

 - `resp` comes from the server running the previous step.
 - `secU` contains sensitive data and should be disposed securely after usage in this step.
 - `context` is a `Uint8List` distinguishing this instantiation of the protocol from others, e.g. "MyApp-v0.2"

 - `sk` is a shared secret, the result of the AKE.
 - `authU1` is an authentication tag that can be passed in step 4 for explicit user authentication.
 - `export_key` can be used to decrypt additional data stored by the server.

### Step 4 (Optional): The server authenticates the user.

This step is only needed if there is no encrypted channel setup
towards the server using the shared secret.

```dart
opaque.UserAuth(authU, authU1);
```

 - `authU` contains sensitive data and should be disposed securely after usage in this step.
 - `authU1` comes from the user running the previous step.
